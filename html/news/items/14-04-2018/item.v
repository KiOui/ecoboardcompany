After years of thorough and detailed research, Boardeco is planned to be launched any day now.  Boardeco is a cost-competitive and ecological alternative for the traditional OSB, MDF and Plywood boards.
Boardeco’s properties exceed the standard board material quality requirements with respect to strength, surface soundness, elasticity, water and fire resistance.
Boardeco is produced from a wide range of natural plant fibres without the use of formaldehyde resins, has a negative carbon footprint and is fully recyclable.
Boardeco is a “cradle to cradle” product and shows how innovative building materials can contribute to the new circular economy.
